The Missouri Southern athletic department had 49 student-athletes named to the MIAA Academic Honor Roll as the league announced its fall academic awards today.

Along with those on the Academic Honor Roll, five individuals earned Scholar-Athlete status and six earned the Academic Excellence Award. To be named to the Academic Honor Roll, a student-athlete must maintain a cumulative 3.0 GPA, be part of the active roster and have at least two academic semesters at the institution. Scholar-Athletes must have at least a 3.5 GPA and be named to an All-MIAA team, while the Academic Excellence Award goes to those that maintain a perfect 4.00 GPA.

The volleyball team had three student-athletes earn the Academic Excellence Award as Janelle Brehm, Morgan Nash and Alicia Pickett all earned honors. Women’s soccer’s Carina Calderon, football’s Matt Griffin and cross country’s Ryan Drendel also earned the honor.

Women’s soccer and football both had two student-athletes named to the Scholar-Athlete team as Jeanine Escobar and Maria Sturluson, as well as Griffin and Hathorn all earned that honor. Pickett picked up that status, as well.
