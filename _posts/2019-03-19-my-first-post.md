Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Just updating this from Prose.

Adding some _style_ to this.  And then an image: ![SD2019]({{site.baseurl}}/SophomoreDay_LOGO.png)
