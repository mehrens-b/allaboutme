The Missouri Southern men’s basketball team was already ranked last week in the media poll and now are ranked in both polls as the Lions come in at No. 22 in the National Association of Basketball Coaches poll and no. 15 in the D2SIDA media poll this week.

In the history of the NABC Poll, the Lions have been ranked 57 times in the program’s history, including high of 23 consecutive weeks. The team has been No. 1 once (in the 2011 season).

The Lions are 9-1 this year and are ranked fifth in the latest Massey College Basketball Ratings.

Southern is one of two teams from the MIAA ranked in both polls as Northwest Missouri is ranked No. 2 in both polls. The complete rankings for each poll are listed below.

The Lions will be back in action on December 19 as Southern plays host to Upper Iowa at noon.
